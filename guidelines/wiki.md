## Structure
### Introduction
The wiki itself is comprised of multiple (not exclusively) markdown files organized into and arbitraty hierarchy of folders. Each markdown file is considered to be a **page**. Pages are composed of **sections**, and each section and their content must conform to the guidelines agreed upon in this page.
### Page types
#### Guidelines
This kind of page should be similar to and RFC standard, it is instructive such that it uses the terms "must", "should", "may", and so on.
#### Processes
Documentation of an end-to-end process, step by step. It can be a solution to a specicic problem or bug that has reoccured or was complicated to solve.
#### Charts
Explain something visually. The team already has a massive collection of charts in Google Drive.
#### Notes
These can include notes from meetings, or from an article that a member of the team read online. This information should be processed further and structured into our taxonomic database. Discovered a new platform? A new tool? A new framework? Note pages should contain the already filtered, TLDR information that is relevant to the business.

## Formatting and content
Although sometimes obvious, every member of the team should contibute to the content of the wiki in order to organize the knowledge that the team gathers. By using taxonomy and stating the obvious, the team can create a hierarchical, indexable repository of all that the team knows. This way, every new member that comes will be able to access this information fast in order to perform a task.
### Language
All documentation should be written in English, with some special terms that are part of our taxonomy database and can be looked up easily. Please use a spellchecker in the IDE or whatever environment the page is being written in.
### Links
Links that point to a different page should include the (full) relative path. They should always be included if the peice of information being described refers to an external resource.
### Sections
The sections within a page each have a type. Since this wiki repository will be ever evolving, there isn't a predefined set of types. 
### Grammar
Passive voice. Avoid the use of "our" "we" and similar terms that refer to a person or the team. Task management tools are there to mitigate responsabilities. Refer to (processes/tools.md)[processes/tools.md] for which tools are used for task management.

## Modifications and versioning
To modify either this page or any other page in the wiki, versioning must be used. Fortunately this is build into git and gitlab. At some point
