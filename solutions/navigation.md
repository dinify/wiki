## Intoduction
Default navigation in a progressive web app environment prodives a web experience. The implementation needs to feel like a native app, that is a more complex navigation tree, rather than the forward and back behavior on the web. Some concepts were introduced early on in the development of mobile operating systems, like Android and iOS that implement lateral navigation, deep linking, and navigation gestures between screens.
