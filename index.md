## Goal
Merge business logic, documentation, and other sources of information into a central, indexable, structured, and hierarhical location. Using versioning will help us "stage" new peices of knowledge and review it before merging it into the main branch.

## Codebase
All code is hosted here, on gitlab. Any code hosted outside of gitlab must be linked here in the wiki.

## Domains
`dinify.app` is the production domain.
`dinify.dev` is the staging domain. Any subdomain created on these domains will need to use a slug formatted version for any resource.

## Taxonomy
These terms describe and standardize parts of the business and the logic guarding it. Pluralization and formatting of terms depend on the context they are used in. For example, in a URL, or in a marketing campaign tracking tag, a term is formatted like a slug: `user-app.dinify.dev`, `rp-onboarding`
